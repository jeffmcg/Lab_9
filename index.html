		<p>PhoneGap is an open-source mobile development framework that was developed by Nitobi and acquired by Adobe in October of 2011. It provides the ability to build mobile applications for many frameworks using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. These apps are hybrid, as they are neither purely native nor purely web-based. PhoneGap Build is a web-based service that uses a "cloud compiler" to generate mobile applications for supported platforms based off of the source code uploaded by a programmer. It allows you to skip installing some of the SDKs, plug-ins, IDEs, etc. The main difference between the two is that PhoneGap runs on your desktop and PhoneGap Build is "in the cloud." With PhoneGap, you download libraries and integrate them into the platform that you want to do. PhoneGap Build is a bit simpler.</p>

	<div data-role="content" data-theme="a">
		<p>Phonegap and PhoneGap Build are two amazing services that can be incredibly useful and time-saving. They are also very easy to use, once you get the hang of it. Developing mobile applications can be a very time-consuming process that is often a bit frustrating as well. The two services do a great job of taking away both the time and frustration involved in the process. PhoneGap and PhoneGap build allow you to create apps with only HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript skills; you don't need to know languages like Java or Objective-C. If you have experience in web development, it is often easier to develop the UI and logic of your application. There is a single code base for all platforms, which is very convenient. Clearly, there are many benefits of using PhoneGap and PhoneGap Build that make it easy to understand why one would want to take advantage of them. </p>

	<div data-role="content" data-theme="a">
		<p>There is a series of steps that you need to complete in order to use the services. First, you need to download Github, make an account with PhoneGap and Github, and sync those accounts. Next, name your home page index.html, include any other files necessary, and zip up the folder. Create a repository in Github, commit the changes, and publish your files, which will put it up on Github's server. Go to PhoneGap Build, click "new app," select the repository you want from Github, enter a description, and click "ready to build". Once the process is completed for the different platforms, you can install them by using the code given or scanning with a QR reader.
